# Project-Description
```Build Week Project - Refugee Stories```

`Team Members: `
Kevin Nguyen (Scrum Manager), Tohm Lev (UX Developer), Spencer Meredith (UI Developer), Rudy Mejia (Front End Architect), Stephen Bondor (Back End Architect)

`Links:`

	Back End - https://refugeestories.herokuapp.com/
	GitHub Organization - https://github.com/team-awesome-s-refugee-stories

`Project Pitch: `
People visiting the site will gain a better understanding of the refugee crisis and what it means to be a refugee. There are more people displaced in the world today than at any time since the end of World War II and it is more important than ever to help people develop empathy for each other. 

`MVP: `
As an admin I can log in and approve or reject submitted stories. As a refugee I can come to the site and submit my story without logging in. 

`MVP Breakdown: `
There are designs that showed how the website should look like.
Web UI has a marketing landing page that is responsive and shows an example of what the site is about. Web Frontend has a deployed website that has working links, features a page that pulls from a database for refugee stories, and features a different page where stories can be submitted to the database. The database used by the frontend is also deployed and successfully interacts with the frontend.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
